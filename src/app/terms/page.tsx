                        <p>
                            Welcome to our platform. These Terms and Conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of our website and services.

                        <p>
                            Registration for our educational and skill development events is conducted exclusively through our online platform. Participants are required to provide accurate, current, and complete information, specifically their name, email address, and phone number, for communication and event management purposes.

                        <p>
                            The platform collects fixed participation fees strictly for event registration. All monetary transactions reflect the cost of attending the specifically chosen workshop or campus-based event. We clearly state that payments are for event participation fees only. We do not provide mechanisms for, nor do we accept, any form of financial contributions that fall outside the purview of event access. Our financial structure focuses entirely on the provision of educational experiences and operational costs tied directly to the scheduled events.

                        <p>
                            To ensure the highest standard of financial security, all payments are processed via a secure third-party payment gateway. Our website does not store card numbers, UPI credentials, internet banking passwords, or any other payment credentials on its servers. By proceeding with a payment, you also acknowledge and accept the respective terms of service and privacy policies of the selected third-party payment gateway provider.
